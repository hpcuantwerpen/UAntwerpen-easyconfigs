description = """
JAGS is Just Another Gibbs Sampler. It is a program for analysis of Bayesian
hierarchical models using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation not wholly
unlike BUGS. JAGS was written with three aims in mind:
* To have a cross-platform engine for the BUGS language
* To be extensible, allowing users to write their own functions, distributions and samplers.
* To be a platform for experimentation with ideas in Bayesian modelling

The functionality of JAGS is based on the BUGS program created by the
MRC Biostatistics Unit (http://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk). There is a short
manual that describes the differences between JAGS and BUGS.

JAGS is licensed under the GNU General Public License version 2. You may freely
modify and redistribute it under certain conditions (see the file COPYING for
details).

The module provides the jags executable and static and dynamic libraries.
The jags command is documented through a man page.
