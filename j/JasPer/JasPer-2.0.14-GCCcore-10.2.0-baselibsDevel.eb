The JasPer Project is an open-source initiative to provide a free software-based

The JasPer software is written in the C programming language.

The JasPer software has been included in the JPEG-2000 Part-5 standard (i.e.,
ISO/IEC 15444-5), as an official reference implementation of the JPEG-2000
Part-1 codec. This software has also been incorporated into numerous other
software projects (some commercial and some non-commercial).
