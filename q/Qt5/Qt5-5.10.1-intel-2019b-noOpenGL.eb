description = """
Qt is a cross-platform GUI development library. It supports not only Windows,
macOS and Linux, but also tablet/phone operating systems such as Android and
iOS and is used in many embedded devices. It is a popular choice for 
developing good-looking cross-platform GUI applications. 

Note Qt is pronounced "Cute".

It is installed with the (L)GPL license.

This module is compiled without support for OpenGL programs. As such it can
be used on all nodes, but not all Qt applications will compile or work.
