description = """
NOTE BEFOREHAND: VASP sometimes shows very bad performance when compiled with
this compiler (though sometimes very good also). But intel-2016b versions
do give more predictable performance, though we have found them to go bad
also in rare cases.

The Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) is a computer program for atomic 
scale materials modelling, e.g. electronic structure calculations and 
quantum-mechanical molecular dynamics, from first principles.

VASP computes an approximate solution to the many-body Schrödinger equation,
either within density functional theory (DFT), solving the Kohn-Sham equations,
or within the Hartree-Fock (HF) approximation, solving the Roothaan equations.
Hybrid functionals that mix the Hartree-Fock approach with density functional
theory are implemented as well. Furthermore, Green's functions methods (GW
quasiparticles, and ACFDT-RPA) and many-body perturbation theory (2nd-order
Møller-Plesset) are available in VASP.

In VASP, central quantities, like the one-electron orbitals, the electronic
charge density, and the local potential are expressed in plane wave basis sets.
The interactions between the electrons and ions are described using
norm-conserving or ultrasoft pseudopotentials, or the projector-augmented-wave
method.

To determine the electronic groundstate, VASP makes use of efficient iterative
matrix diagonalisation techniques, like the residual minimisation method with
direct inversion of the iterative subspace (RMM-DIIS) or blocked Davidson
algorithms. These are coupled to highly efficient Broyden and Pulay density
mixing schemes to speed up the self-consistency cycle.

This module contains non-GPU versions of vasp_std, vasp_gam and vasp_ncl.

VASP is licensed software. Only members of the avasp group can use VASP.

usage = """
The VASP documentation can be found on the VASP web site www.vasp.at.
Keep in mind that VASP can require a lot of memory and perform a lot of I/O
when you are not exploiting parallelism sufficiently. Please choose your
settings and cluster resources carefully to exploit sufficient parallelism and
limit I/O. If you fail to do so, the result is slower running jobs, a more busy
cluster and longer wait time for you and your colleagues.
