The vsc-tutorial module contains a number of example programs that are used
during the hands-on sessions of the HPC tutorial at UAntwerp. These commands
can be used to experiment with starting various types of programs on 
the clusters.

Sources can be accessed after loading the module in the directory

It might be useful to also have a look at the torque-tools module.
