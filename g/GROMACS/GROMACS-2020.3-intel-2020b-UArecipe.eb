#   done in a regular CMakeMake EasyConfig.
# - It only does the build and install steps for each component but does not
#   run the tests. So we do it through the buildopts. runtest as a field is
#   not honoured. And as a variable, it cause Bundle to malfunction.

# We compile with the default options chosen by the CMake recipes. When checking
# what the GROMACS compile did, it was clear that the authors have put some effort
# in selecting compiler options for each compiler vendor, as the ones that are used
# are all but trivial. However, it turned out that on Ivy Bridge CPUs, with their 
# options not all tests passed correctly. Specifically, three tests of their vector
# kernels for the exponential failed for arguments that produce a result close to
# denormalized numbers. After testing several combinations of floating point
# optimization options, it seems that setting -no-ftz is the key towards a solution.
#
# Note that we pass only our own extra options via CMAKE_C_FLAGS etc as the default
# in GROMACS is to add these in front of the options it selects itsel (which someone
# told me can also be turned off).
