description = """
GObject introspection is a middleware layer between C libraries (using GObject)
and language bindings. The C library can be scanned at compile time and generate
a metadata file, in addition to the actual native C library. Then at runtime,
language bindings can read this metadata and automatically provide bindings to
call into the C library.

This module provides the command line tools and static and shared libraries.
It was compiled to use Python 2.7.
