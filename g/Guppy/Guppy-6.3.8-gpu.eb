description = """
Guppy is a data processing toolkit that contains the Oxford Nanopore 
Technologies' basecalling algorithms, and several bioinformatic 
post-processing features. It is provided as a separate package, as well as 
being integrated with MinKNOW, the Oxford Nanopore device control software.

Early downstream analysis components such as barcoding/demultiplexing, adapter 
trimming and alignment are contained within Guppy. Furthermore, Guppy now 
performs modified basecalling (5mC, 6mA and CpG) from the raw signal data, 
producing an additional FAST5 file of modified base probabilities.
