description = """
Libxml2 is the XML C parser and toolkit developed for the Gnome project (but
usable outside of the Gnome platform), it is free software available under the
MIT License. XML itself is a metalanguage to design markup languages, i.e. text
language where semantic and structure are added to the content using extra
"markup" information enclosed between angle brackets. HTML is the most
well-known markup language. Though the library is written in C a variety of
language bindings make it available in other environments.

This module provides command line tools and static and shared libraries.
"""

usage = """
The module provides a number of command line tools
+ xmlcatalog: Parse and manipulate XML or SGML catalog files
+ xmllint:    Comand-line XML parser
+ xml-config: Provides information about the installed version of the library
xmlcatalog and xmllint also support --help

The library API is documented on the libxml website.
