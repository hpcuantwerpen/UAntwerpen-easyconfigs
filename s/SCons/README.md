## General information

* SCons is Python software
    * Version 3.1 (when this documentation was first written) Requires 2.7 or 3.5+


## EasyBuild

This documentation was written when installing version 3.1.2 in the 2020a
build round.

There is support for SCons in the [
EasyBuilders repository](https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyconfigs/tree/develop/easybuild/easyconfigs/s/SCons).
It however relies on EasyBuild-generated Python modules which is kind of stupid
for a tool that is used to install some very basic software.


### 3.1.2

* Developed with the goal of integrating into out buildtools module.
* Started from an EasyBuilders recipe.
* Switched to the SYSTEM toolchain and using a system-installed Python.
* Since we already had a package in the buildtools bundle that requires Python 3
  (Meson) we decided to go for Python 3. This implies:
    * Forcing EasyBuild to use the right Python executable by setting
      req_py_majver and req_py_minver.
    * Since the wrapper script use `/usr/bin/env python`, we edited them with
      sed to use `python3` instead to ensure that the right version of Python
      corresponding to the installed libraries is used. Otherwise we could
      expect conflicts with the PYTHONPATH in buildtools.
* Since our system Python does not have pip installed, we turned off pip
  installation.


### 4.3.0

  * Installation from sources didn't work on Vaughan, likely because setuptools
    in the system Python is too old.

  * Installation from a wheel is a real option as this is a pure Python package.
    It did take some work to get this to work in a Bundle context, basically
    because the unpacking is done in a different way than in a PythonPackage
    EasyConfig as the default list of extract_cmds doesn't recognize .whl files.
    The problematic code is partly in `easybuild/tools/filetools.py` in the
    EasyBuild framework.
