SCons is an Open Source software construction toolâ€”that is, a next-generation
build tool. Think of SCons as an improved, cross-platform substitute for the
classic Make utility with integrated functionality similar to autoconf/automake
and compiler caches such as ccache. In short, SCons is an easier, more reliable
and faster way to build software.
